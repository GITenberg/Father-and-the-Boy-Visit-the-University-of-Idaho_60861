<p>&ldquo;Well, son&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father and son had a minute alone together on the first evening
of their first visit to their own state university&mdash;Idaho. Arriving on
a Friday afternoon in February, they had been captured by Tom
Collins, a sophomore from their home town in south Idaho, and carried
off before they knew it to his fraternity house on the college hill.</p>
<p>Here they had seen a pair of grinning freshmen hustled into other
quarters to make room for them, had partaken of an abundant, well-cooked
supper, had heard a lively program of college songs, and were
resting up a bit before starting out to look things over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They surely are fine fellows, dad. Tom&rsquo;s told me a lot about
them before, but I only half believed him. Why, I feel as much at
home as if I&rsquo;d known them for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re good business men, too, if they are only youngsters. Did
you hear the steward explaining how they were saving money on food;
and all the seniors jumping on the kids who didn&rsquo;t pay their bills? I
wonder if all the houses are run like this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill Jones says his crowd is a whole lot better. And then there&rsquo;s
Lindley Hall, managed by the University. That&rsquo;s where Stubby Scott
is living and he&rsquo;s crazy about it. We&rsquo;re going there tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we go anywhere tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we? There&rsquo;s a basketball game at the Gym, and after
that a student play in the Auditorium. Then Bill wants us to drop in
at his house and get acquainted there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;But son, it&rsquo;s seven now, and at home I always try to be in bed by
nine. Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tap on the door interrupted his protests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; came a voice from the hall. &ldquo;Game begins early
tonight on account of the play. We&rsquo;ll have to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the Gymnasium crowded from floor to roof, with
just enough space left for the ten lithe, active young fellows who were
already dashing back and forth between the baskets. As the visitors
worked their way to the balcony, a slender athlete in white and gold
dropped the ball neatly through the hoop, and bam!&mdash;an explosion of
voices shook the rafters so that Father clutched at his guides and suddenly
remembered that a doctor had once warned him about his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what happened?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First score for Idaho, sir. Looks like a tight game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was a tight game. Time and again the score was tied.
Then another Idaho player would find the basket and pandemonium
would break loose once more. A thrilling last-minute rally brought
Idaho to the front and the game was won just as the timer&rsquo;s gun cracked.</p>
<p>The boy was radiant, breathless. His new friends could speak
only in whispers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Physical Director over there,&rdquo; one of them pointed. &ldquo;Greatest
football coach in the Northwest. Like to meet him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="229" height="601" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like it,&rdquo; the Coach was saying
to Father a few minutes later, while the Boy kept
silent and admired. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like regular,
well-coached athletics to keep a boy&mdash;or girl
either&mdash;sound and healthy during college years
and when they get out in life. We try to get everybody
into these sports here, so they will enjoy
the exercise they get. We have class teams and
fraternity teams; first, second and third teams;
and this Gymnasium&rsquo;s just the busiest place on
the campus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it take much time from their studies?&rdquo;
asked Father, always cautious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. It clears their brains and they
can study all the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather make the big teams&mdash;like the one
tonight,&rdquo; suggested the boy.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll have a good chance, too. Everybody in school has,
after his first year.&rdquo; Then the Coach got enthusiastic. &ldquo;Before long
every high-school boy in Idaho will be looking to the day when he can
represent his own state university in athletic sports. We&rsquo;ll have Idaho
coaches in Idaho schools and our teams here will be a big factor in
making every citizen proud that he lives in Idaho. There&rsquo;s no finer
loyalty anywhere than our boys have right now. That&rsquo;s why we win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over in an adjoining building Father and the Boy found a spacious
auditorium, beautiful beyond their dreams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say it&rsquo;s like the old college chapels in England, only newer,&rdquo;
volunteered Tom. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about such things.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Student Performers of a Clever Modern Comedy</i></p>
</div>
<p>Soon the curtain rose on an attractively-set stage, and student performers,
with almost professional skill, began the performance of a
clever modern comedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they often do this?&rdquo; asked Father between acts. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s first-class
training for the actors and the audience too. I&rsquo;ve always wanted
my children to know good plays and good music and good books.
I&rsquo;ve had so little chance for such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was assured that there were plays as good as this several times
a year, with a special one at commencement time. Better still, every
student in the University could try out for the parts and in certain
classes there was practice in writing plays as well as acting them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Next morning Father and the Boy were routed out of a sound
sleep and hurried down to breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the fellows have eight-o&rsquo;clocks,&rdquo; Tom explained. &ldquo;They
check up mighty close on absences here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father nodded his approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take you to see the President first,&rdquo; Tom went on.
&ldquo;He never seems to be too busy to meet new people.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>An Auditorium, Beautiful Beyond Their Dreams</i></p>
</div>
<p>As they strolled up the pathway to the Administration Building
in the sunshine of that February morning, the beauty of the campus
and its surroundings was revealed to them as they had not even
imagined it the night before. The rich Gothic lines of the Administration
Building stood out sharply against the rolling hills of the
Palouse country, still glistening with snow. To the south appeared the
Engineering Building and Ridenbaugh Hall, pleasing in architecture
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
and harmonizing with the main building in the soft red of their walls
and the weathered green of the roofs. Slightly to the rear was the
Gymnasium, looking peaceful enough now, after the hard battle of
the previous night.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="515" />
<p class="pcap"><i>To the North&mdash;Agriculture, Mines and Forestry</i></p>
</div>
<p>Off to the north, separated by a driveway, stood the closely-clustered
buildings devoted to Agriculture, Mines and Forestry. Tom
explained that in the valley beyond these was the large experimental
farm, with its stock barns, and poultry house. Near at hand he pointed
out the Music Building, the University hut, and the Infirmary, and
called attention to Lindley Hall and the numerous fraternity and sorority
houses clustered about. Students were hurrying to and fro on
the walks, for inside the building a gong had just sounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s a little city in itself!&rdquo; was the Boy&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s getting bigger all the time,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;There are
more than eleven hundred students on the campus right now&mdash;fully
twice as many as there were five years ago. I sometimes wonder
where they put us all, but we always have found room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05a.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="357" height="601" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad to meet anybody from
Idaho, particularly south Idaho,&rdquo;
was the greeting Father got from the
President. &ldquo;People in the north have
known all about us for years and long
ago got the habit of sending their
children here. But now all the state
is acquiring the habit. State pride
and state unity can mean a great deal
for Idaho, and the University of Idaho
should be the greatest agent in developing
this spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been figuring it this way,&rdquo;
said Father. &ldquo;As my boys grow up
and get into business in Idaho, they
will need just the kind of friends, all
over the state, that they will come to know in four years here at the
University.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you,&rdquo; the President assured him. &ldquo;We are
training Idaho boys and girls for the life of Idaho. Just let us show
you around the buildings and you will see more and more how closely
our courses are related to all the important industries of the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the pilgrimage commenced. Father and the Boy first made
a thorough round of the Administration Building, largely devoted to
classes in Letters and Science. They acquired a somewhat blurred
impression of rows and rows of library shelves, of crowded laboratories,
of vigorous class-room discussion, and of an array of scientific
apparatus that bewildered them. But they caught certain ideas very
clearly.</p>
<p>They saw how personal most of this instruction was, what constant
opportunity was given for direct contact of student and instructor,
how every effort was made to encourage students to think for
themselves. They noted too the serious purpose each instructor
brought to his work and the interest he took in the young people under
his direction. Father was especially pleased with the vitality of the
subject matter and the constant applications which were made of it
to present-day conditions. He grew so interested in several classrooms
that they could hardly drag him away, and the Boy was sure
he was going to break in and ask questions. In the course in Business
Administration they were talking about taxation and railroad rates
and other things he had such deep interest in.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The Administration Building, largely devoted to Letters and Science</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Next Father insisted on visiting the College of Law, half expecting
to find an actual court-room in full operation. He found more
shelves of books and more busy students, and learned with satisfaction
how the College is shaping its courses to fit the particular needs of
the state.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="608" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Ridenbaugh Hall, the Women&rsquo;s Building</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mining law, irrigation law, and the law of community property
are subjects we have to emphasize here,&rdquo; said the Dean of the College.
&ldquo;Our numbers are growing fast, and our graduates, while still young,
are making good wherever they go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;School of Education,&rdquo; read Father, as they passed an office door.
&ldquo;You boys go on if you want to, but the girls are going to prepare
for teaching in a few years, and I&rsquo;d like to talk to these people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found an interesting and affable group of men who knew as
much about the schools in his home county as he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teaching is a splendid field for service just now in Idaho,&rdquo; they
told him. &ldquo;The supply of trained teachers is entirely unequal to the
demand, and there is such a shortage of teachers in other states that
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
we cannot import from outside as we used to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you prepare teachers for the grades here?&rdquo; asked Father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; they told him, &ldquo;that is done at the state normal schools.
Our work is along other lines. We prepare high-school teachers, principals,
and superintendents, and give special training to teachers of
agriculture, home economics, music, and physical education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even though Father was on the school board at home, this array
of names was a bit confusing, but he found familiar ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This home economics,&rdquo; he said with a show of confidence&mdash;&ldquo;really
cooking and general housework gone to college, I&rsquo;d say. We&rsquo;ve just
installed an outfit for it in our home school that cost a lot of money.
I&rsquo;ll have to see what you have here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="622" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Home Economics&mdash;A Booth in the Christmas Bazaar</i></p>
</div>
<p>At the other end of the long corridor he found the laboratories
of the Home Economics department, complete and modern in their
equipment. There was a fragrance in the air like baking-day at home,
and a group of white-aproned young women were bustling about, very
much intent on their work.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Plenty of Opportunities to Enjoy Themselves</i></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The instructor introduced Father to the Dean of Women and to
the mother of one of the girls, who was also making a visit to the
University and being escorted about the buildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certainly glad we decided to send our daughter here,&rdquo; she
assured Father. &ldquo;The work is just what she needs and the teachers
have her more interested than she ever was before. She has so many
good friends here, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning girls or boys?&rdquo; asked Father with a little smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, both,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;The whole social atmosphere is very
wholesome. The young people have plenty of opportunities to enjoy
themselves, but they are always carefully directed and chaperoned.
They have all the rules they need, but I don&rsquo;t think there are too many,
and there is a Women&rsquo;s League of the girls to enforce the ones they
have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="397" />
<p class="pcap"><i>A Tense Moment on the Gridiron</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I like to see young folks have a good time,&rdquo; Father informed her,
&ldquo;but it does seem that somebody has to look after them. I suppose
that&rsquo;s where you come in,&rdquo; he added to the Dean of Women.</p>
<p>She was able to explain in more detail the wide variety of recreation
available on the campus. Father was particularly pleased when
she said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;The spirit of the University is generally democratic. Everybody
knows everybody else and there is no distinction of rich or poor. Hundreds
of boys and girls are earning all or part of their expenses and are
respected all the more for doing so. Fraternities and sororities may
have intense rivalry among themselves but they are not snobbish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the girls get any of this physical culture, or whatever you call
it?&rdquo; asked Father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly do, and we give them more and better opportunities
every year. They have a very competent woman to direct their
classes and give corrective exercises to those who need them. They
now have a chance at inter-class sports just as the men have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladies excused themselves, explaining that they were due to
visit the Music Building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you acquainted with the work in music here?&rdquo; the other
visitor asked of Father. He confessed that he was not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did hear the University Glee Club in our town last winter,&rdquo; he
explained, &ldquo;and all the boys at the house where we&rsquo;re staying can sing
like birds. I didn&rsquo;t know they had any regular department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed they have. It is growing rapidly under some very competent
instruction. My daughter thought she would have to drop her
music when she left home, but she can carry it right through her entire
course. She&rsquo;s interested in both piano and violin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out on the campus once more, Father found Tom and the Boy with
a dozen or more students in military uniforms hurrying along from the
direction of the Gymnasium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dad, you should have seen the military work!&rdquo; the Boy sang
out across the campus. &ldquo;Tom here says he doesn&rsquo;t like it much, but
it looks good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom shrugged his shoulders with the superior manner of one
who knows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have a unit of the R. O. T. C. here&mdash;the Reserve Officers&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Training Corps, you know. Every fellow has to take military his first
two years, and then if he wants to keep it up, he may become an officer
when he graduates. And he has a uniform furnished him, and
gets sent to summer camps, and shoots in the rifle range&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s
bully! And you just ought to hear the military band!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a mighty good department,&rdquo; Tom confessed. &ldquo;One of the
best in the West, the War Department says. And the Colonel and all
the officers are mighty good scouts. We&rsquo;ll have to get to these other
buildings now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="412" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The University Gymnasium</i></p>
</div>
<p>Father owned a farm, and soon found his way to the College of
Agriculture. &ldquo;You represent the state&rsquo;s biggest business,&rdquo; he assured
the Dean. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always telling the boy so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and if your son expects to make scientific
agriculture his life work, as teacher, experimental expert, extension
worker, or as operator and manager of a farm of his own, this University
is the place for him. Farming conditions in Idaho are distinctive,
and he can best prepare to meet them in the Agricultural College of
his own state, where they are made a special study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father enjoyed every minute of the hour that followed, during
which he was personally conducted through the agricultural buildings
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
and over the farm. Model dairy barns, chicken pens, up-to-date crop
demonstrations crowded upon each other. The tractor school then in
session particularly interested Father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been a farmer all my life,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I would enter this
Agricultural College right now if my son were not ahead of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a ringing of gongs throughout the buildings and students
came hurrying out as fast as they had entered in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lunch time,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;If you go with Stubby to Lindley, you
will need to be on time. They&rsquo;re mighty prompt about their meals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father expressed disappointment that he had not visited all departments.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p09a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="261" />
<p class="pcap"><i>One of the Best in the West</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can take in the others this afternoon, even if it is Saturday,&rdquo;
Tom assured him. &ldquo;Classes do not meet, but there are always people
working in these shops and laboratories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lunch at Lindley Hall, with 150 boys and a number of professors,
was an abundant and attractive meal. Since it was Saturday these
boys lingered too to sing a few songs, and Father and the Boy got acquainted
with a large number of fellows from their part of the state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are nearly all freshmen,&rdquo; the Proctor of the hall told them.
&ldquo;Freshmen had a rather hard time of it, scattered all over town, till
the people of Moscow made this building available to us. We are
able to charge very reasonable rental to the boys and still meet our
obligations to the citizens. The rooms are light and attractive, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
the dining department is very skillfully conducted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Proctor also explained his duties as financial adviser to the
students, while Father listened with approval. Then they started on
a further tour of inspection, this time with Stubby as guide.</p>
<p>Just outside of Lindley Hall Stubby remarked, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop here at
the Infirmary and see Vic Nelson. He&rsquo;s laid up with some kind of
pip and would surely like to see somebody from home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="405" />
<p class="pcap"><i>He was Personally Conducted Over the Farm</i></p>
</div>
<p>The infirmary, unpretentious on the outside, was a revelation to
them within. The rooms were spotless and the trained nurse in
charge seemed to know exactly how to make sick youngsters forget
their troubles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you get in here, anyhow?&rdquo; asked the Boy. &ldquo;I expect to
come around every time I need a rest cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; the nurse explained. &ldquo;I hold consultation
hours every day for students who are ailing, and go to see those who
are confined to their rooms. If they need a doctor I have them get
one. If a day or two in bed will fix them up, we bring them here,
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
but if they seem to be in for a longer illness, they are taken to a hospital
down town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t all you do,&rdquo; added Stubby none too pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s referring to my sanitary inspections,&rdquo; she said laughing.
&ldquo;I make inspection trips to all the rooming houses when they
least expect it, and rate them on cleanliness, neatness, and general
sanitary condition. They really don&rsquo;t mind, but they pretend to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have no right to mind.&rdquo; Father was emphatic now. &ldquo;When
I use good money sending children to college I want to know that they
live right and take care of their health. Is there a medical school
connected with the University?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the nurse. &ldquo;There is a very high-grade
Pre-Medical course though, which prepares students for the best medical
schools. Many Idaho boys save as much as a year of expensive
medical training back east by completing this Pre-Medical work here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the little procession moved over to the Agricultural Building
again, where they still wished to look in on the School of Forestry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got some fine young shade trees from here last year,&rdquo; said
Father to the Dean, &ldquo;and I thought I&rsquo;d call and see if the supply is
exhausted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;And yet we have distributed
175,000 of these trees throughout Idaho in the last two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We people in the south forget sometimes what an interest this
state has in forestry,&rdquo; Father told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fully forty per cent of Idaho is permanent forest land, you
know,&rdquo; said the Dean, &ldquo;and the forestry problems of the state are of
great importance. Our interest is divided between working on these
and preparing young men for the forest service and the lumber industry.
We are drawing students from all over the country but we can&rsquo;t
train them and turn them out fast enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the School of Mines nearby Father learned a similar lesson of
the importance of the work to the state and a demand for competent
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
graduates all out of proportion to the numbers the school was able to
supply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our teaching falls into three main divisions,&rdquo; he was told: &ldquo;geology,
to make the students familiar with the nature and occurrence of
ores and minerals; mining engineering, concerned with the extraction
of these ores from the earth; and metallurgy, in which we study the
methods employed in making valuable metal from crude ore.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="601" />
<p class="pcap"><i>We Can&rsquo;t Train Them Fast Enough</i></p>
</div>
<p>Father and son both were so fascinated by the possibilities of
these laboratories that practically every piece of apparatus had to be
set going for them before they were content to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could all have the benefit of this kind of training,&rdquo; Father
remarked somewhat sadly, &ldquo;we wouldn&rsquo;t all be such fools over mining
stocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The professor only smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Back across the campus they went to the College of Engineering.
The Boy had been dabbling in electricity and mechanics all through
his high-school course and was soon absorbed in a discussion of wireless
telephones with the professor in charge. Father walked rather
gingerly among the whirring belts and singing dynamos, but felt more
at home in the wood and metal working shops nearby. The values
of the course in Chemical Engineering were explained to him at some
length, but Civil Engineering he knew all about.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p11a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="494" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The College of Engineering</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to preach water power and irrigation to us in the
south,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;We know that the future of Idaho lies in her
unlimited water supply and we want plenty of our own boys trained
to harness and adapt this to our needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good roads laboratory also appealed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been telling our supervisors for weeks that they are planning
to use poor stuff on our county roads this year,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll
prove it to them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The afternoon was far spent, but Father still insisted on walking
down through the town of Moscow while the Saturday crowd was on
the streets. He found a busy little city, with good buildings, wide
and well-paved streets, and cordial, public-spirited citizens. He learned
of the excellent schools, the many churches and the high moral tone
of the entire community. He was particularly impressed with the
interest of the church people in the social and spiritual life of the students,
and commended them highly for their zeal in employing a non-denominational
student pastor to give his entire time to student welfare.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>In the Same Old Gymnasium</i></p>
</div>
<p>It ended all too soon&mdash;that wonderful week-end visit at the University
of Idaho. Saturday night the Boy had the time of his life at
the annual Military Ball, in the same old over-worked Gymnasium,
transformed now into a bower of beauty and bright with colored lights
and dainty evening dresses. Father looked on from the gallery and
wished that Mother could be there to see. Next day came church services
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
in town, conversation and more music in the fraternity living
room, and a Vesper Recital in the Auditorium at twilight. There was
a mad rush for the railway station, a chorus of good-bye shouts, and
the holiday was over.</p>
<p>As they settled back in the Pullman, the Boy&rsquo;s eyes glistened with
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can hardly wait for next fall to come. I want
so much to be a part of this splendid University life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father was silent for a minute. Then he spoke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go a long way before we find a better place for you or
the girls either. It&rsquo;s liberal and democratic, and it&rsquo;s building mighty
fine citizens for the state of Idaho. What was the song we heard so
often about the campus and the crested hill? I can&rsquo;t quite get it
straightened out, but it certainly touches the spot.&rdquo;</p>

over and over again:</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
